## 100 Days of Rust

Let's start to practice the RUST. There is the rule. **Write the code in person.** Before the practice, Read the document to study the rust grammar on the [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). When you create the new repository, Use the command such as `cargo new day1` in the src directory.
