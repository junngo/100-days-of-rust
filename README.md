## 100 Days of Rust

Let's start to practice the RUST. There is the rule. **Write the code in person.** Before the practice, Read the document to study the rust grammar on the [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
I wrote detailed descriptions to do in each day's project. Read the mission and then start to write the code in your editor.
Our work directory is src. When you create the new project, Use the command such as `cargo new day2` in the src directory.
