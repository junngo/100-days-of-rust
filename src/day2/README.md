## Day 2

### Task

1.  - Makes the one variable `x`. Initial the value `100`.
    - Change the value from `100` to `200` and then print the `x`
2.  - Makes the one variable `y`. Initial the value `300`.
    - Change the value from `300` to `400` without the `mut` keyword and then print the `y`

### What I learned

- Rust variables are immutable.
- If you make the variable mutable, Use the `mut` keyword.
- Shadow the ahead variable. But When the type is different with the first variable and second variable, We can't shadow the first variable from second variable.
