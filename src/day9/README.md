## Day 9

### Task

- Slice the `Hello, world` contents to get the `Hello` word.
- Read `main.rs` code and docs to practice the slice.

### What I learned

- How to slice the string
- String literals and String are the different. String literal is immutable and we can just reference it without the modify.
