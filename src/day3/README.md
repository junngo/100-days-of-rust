## Day 3

### Task

- Declare the four primary scalar types and Print it.
  - Scalary types: integers(i32), floating point(f64), Booleans(true, false), and characters('r')
- Declare the tuple type and Print it. Also practice the `destructuring` too.
- Declare the array to manage the week(sun ... sat) and print it.

### What I learned

- Rust has four primary scalar types such as integers(i32), floating point(f64), Booleans(true, false), and characters('r').
  - Characters are different from Strings. Char literals use single quotes. String uses double quotes.
- Rust has two primitive compound types such as tuples and arrays.
  - Tuple: Grouping the variety of types into one compound type. When we use the `destructuring` of a tuple, we can make the tuple into each parts.
  - Array: Grouping one type value into the array type. There is a difference from the other languages. Rust arrays have a fixed length. If we need to manage the fixed values such as week and month, Array is useful.
