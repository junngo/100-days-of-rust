## Day 6

### Task

- Print the number between 1 and 10 by for loop
- Print the four thimes table
- Multiply each element of array by 2. Array sample - [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. And Print it.

### What I learned

- Return the value from the loop to initalize the variable.
- We can use the loop lable. But I don't want to use it because loop lable increase the code complexity.
- How to use the `for loop`, and `while` (also with the array)
